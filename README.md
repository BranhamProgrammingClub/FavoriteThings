# FavoriteThings
A project that prints out an (interesting) list of favorite things for Branham Programming Club.

Please make your code be a bit more than just `print` statements. If you're feeling ambitious try to use a concept you've recently learned.

### To Run

```bash
python setup.py build
# â†“ if this doesn't work you can also copy the file
ln -sr build/lib*/* .
python main.py
```

If it doesn't work you may have a corrupted Python environment. Try reinstalling ;)
